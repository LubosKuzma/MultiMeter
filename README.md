# MultiMeter

Hello,

welcome to the *MultiMeter Project* develped by the Hardware Hacking Club (HHC) at SAIT.
The intent is to design, program and build an open-source multimeter that will measure voltage and current, and display these on OLED display. It will be used to retrofit old(er) analog bench-top power supply. The system will be based on PIC 8 bit microcontroller platform.

Lubos
